📰 Fake News Detector with Histogram

This repository contains a Fake News Detection System built using Machine Learning. The model analyzes text data to classify whether a news article is real or fake. Additionally, a histogram visualization is included to better understand the data distribution.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of news datasets (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).

Machine Learning model for detecting fake vs. real news.

Histogram visualizations for feature/data analysis.

Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy reproducibility.
